## Welcome to Fans of LeFox

This project has the sole purpose of promoting the actress Jorja Fox, found at [JorjaFox.net](https://jorjafox.net).

Due to the nature of materials (images, news articles, transcripts etc) we can claim no copyright or ownership over much of the content. That said, we make use of GitHub to manage and organize the code, track changes, and ensure the consistent uptime and functionality of the website.
